STEPS TO BE DONE BEFORE THE MainScreen
Before we design the Main Screen , we need to do the following:
1. Add support of conio2.h in our project
2. Create a header file called "car.h" which will contain structure declarations, typedef statements and function declarations
3. Create a source code file called "car.c" which will contain definitions of the functions declared in the file "car.h"
